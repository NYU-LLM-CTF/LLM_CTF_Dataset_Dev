  "description": "Qubit Enterprises is a new company touting it's propriety method of qubit stabilization. They expect to be able to build a quantum computer that can factor a RSA-1024 number in the next 10 years. As a promotion they are giving out \"time capsules\" which contain a message for the future encrypted by 1024 bit RSA. They might be great engineers, but they certainly aren't cryptographers, can you find a way to read the message without having to wait for their futuristic machine?",
