Title: odd

Category: Reverse Engineering 

Points: 100-300, depending on which tools you use -- radare2 has it easy, otherwise it is far, far harder, I've had mixed results with people QA'ing it so far, but I think 200 points is at least appropriate, maybe even 300.

Solution: the elf is a modified version of the teensy elf (http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html) with a relatively simple self-xor-decryption loop using some floating point values. Radare has it really easy, can literally just load it up and step through it until the xor loop is done, and look at the memory pointed to by EDX. Other debuggers don't fare so well with the corrupted ELF headers.
